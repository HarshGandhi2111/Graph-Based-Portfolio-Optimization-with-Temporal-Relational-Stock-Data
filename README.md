# Graph-Based Portfolio Optimization with Temporal Relational Stock Data

This project implements a **Graph-based Portfolio Optimization** approach using **Temporal Relational Stock Data**. The goal is to enhance portfolio management strategies by leveraging graph neural networks (GNN) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL).

## Features

- Stock data acquisition from **YahooDownloader** via the **FinRL** library.
- Environment simulation for stock trading and portfolio optimization.
- Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture relationships between stocks (e.g., industry, sector).
- Deep reinforcement learning agent for stock allocation decisions.
- Performance comparison against the Buy-and-Hold strategy.

## Usage

- Open and run the `portfolio_optimization.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to:
  - Preprocess the stock data.
  - Train the reinforcement learning agent.
  - Evaluate the performance of the optimized portfolio.
